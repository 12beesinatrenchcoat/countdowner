# countdowner
A countdown webapp. 

## current status
Please don't use this. A lot of stuff is still missing.

## why does this exist?
I wanted a reason to learn TypeScript, use esbuild, and to learn how Progressive Web Applications worked. So I decided to try and build a countdown app.

## building
`npm ci` and `npm build`. 

## contributing
This is a personal project. Feel free to yell if I did anything wrong, but please don't add features without raising an issue first.
